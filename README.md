# DSCA_intropython_dev

To run the course, follow the steps below:
1) open the Index.ipynb in notebook folder
2) for Index.ipynb and all other notebooks, please run the import function (the first chunk of the code) first.
this sets the style and functionality of the notebook. 
3) You can navigate to different sections from Index.ipynb
4) Please do not "clear all cell outputs" as this would hide all code answers. 
Should you have done this accidently, you should close and reopen the notebook.
5) You can return to Index notebook at any time by pressing the Home button at the top of each section notebook.
