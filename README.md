**Course Summary** 

This course is delivered through the Jupyter notebook application. 
It begins with a coverage of fundamental building blocks in Python -  numeric data types, strings, lists, 
dictionaries, sets - replete with examples. Illustrations are then provided on the use of these data types
to compose code with selection and iteration constructs.  To promote modular and readable code the set-up
and use of functions with parameters are also covered. 

**Course Objective**

Participants should attain a good understanding of basic data types in Python and associated methods 
and constructs that can be applied to them.
