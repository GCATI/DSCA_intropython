# Introduction to Python Programming

### Version 1.1 

**Course Summary** 

This course is delivered through the Jupyter notebook application. 
It begins with a coverage of fundamental building blocks in Python -  numeric data types, strings, lists, 
dictionaries, sets - replete with examples. Illustrations are then provided on the use of these data types
to compose code with selection and iteration constructs.  To promote modular and readable code the set-up 
and use of functions with parameters are also covered. Specialised knowledge in data analysis is then 
developed through a comprehensive overview of the Pandas library. The two main data structures in
this library â€“ the series and dataframe and associated methods are explained with clarifying examples
on how to select, filter, aggregate and merge data. Keys tasks like handling null values, 
applying functions, plotting are also highlighted.  Each section has exercises for participants 
to attempt to consolidate their learning.

**Learning Outcome**

Participants should attain a good understanding of basic data types in Python and associated methods 
and constructs that can be applied to them. They should also become knowledgeable in how to
deal with tabular data through using the specialised data structures found in the Pandas library and 
how to perform key analysis through methods available in this library.
