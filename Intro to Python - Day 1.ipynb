    "* Familiarise yourself with the Jupyter notebook, which is what we'll use to interact with python\n",
    "* Be able to describe Python's basic data types - integers, floats, strings and Booleans.\n",

    "* Python is interoperable across multiple computing platforms (e.g. Windows, Mac, Linux)\n",
    "* Used by many people, giving it a large user base.\n",
    "* Open-source - It is much more cost effective and easier to maintain than SAS and SPSS\n",
    "* Extensible - A broad range of modules: Data Management, Visualisation, Statistics, Machine Learning, Scientific Computing...\n",
    "* High-level - Concise expressions compared to low-level languages (e.g. c, java etc.) giving greater productivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of different ways of interacting with python, in fact your anaconda install gives you three different options:\n",
    "* Jupyter notebook - a straightforward browser-based interactive python environment great for data analysis tasks.\n",
    "* IPython qtconsole - a stripped-down, command line python application, suitable for more advanced users. \n",

    "\n",
    "* A cell in **Edit Mode** has a green border and a cursor in the cell indicating that you can write in the cell.\n",
    "* A cell in **Command Mode** has a blue border, this indicates that you are not editing a specific cell, but instead allows you to control the properties of the whole notebook using keyboard shortcuts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the time you'll be using edit mode, this is the default when you click into a cell and start typing code. Command mode is really for more advanced users who have memorised some of the notebook keyboard shortcuts. To enter command mode, you can either click outside of the cell space (i.e. on the grey border space), or press Esc when you are editing a cell.\n",

    "# Python Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Object is the general name for data types, data structures, functions and so on that python stores in memory and references with an identifier. Technically, an object is a specific instance of a 'class', which is an abstract template for a data type, data structure etc. A class is a pattern for creating new objects that can be reused and extended.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "days_list = [\"Mon\", \"Tues\", \"Weds\", \"Thurs\", \"Fri\", \"Sat\", \"Sun\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "`days_list` is the identifier for a python 'list' data structure (object) that in this case stores some text values.\n",
    "\n",
    "All objects have properties and methods, which relate to data that the object stores and behaviours (procedures) that can be performed on the object to get a specific output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessing the properties and methods of an object usually means using the '.' (dot notation). This means we type the name of the object we are interested in, put a dot, then type the name of the property or method we want to call.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, calling the `clear()` method of a list object named `fruit` would be achieved like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fruit.clear()\n",
    "```\n",
    "This would have the effect of removing any items stored by the list `fruit`, emptying the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, if we wanted to use the count method to count the number of times a particular item occured in a list, we might do the following:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fruit = ['apple','apple','banana','orange'] # create a list called fruit.\n",
    "fruit.count('apple') # count the number of times that the string 'apple' occurs in the fruit list\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the above, we would expect the `.count()` method, with the parameter 'apple' to return the value 2, because 'apple' appears twice in the list `fruit`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, there are some special in-built python functions that interact with objects and perform special behaviours, like `print()` and `len()`, or the numeric functions (e.g. `pow()`) you've seen already.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, calling the python `print()` function enables us to print a representation of an object based on how a given object behaves with respect to that function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "* The python list object is (possibly) the most versatile of the built in data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It can hold any sequence of objects, including mixes of objects like strings, integers and Boolean variables together.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lists can also hold other lists and dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "* They can also hold custom data structures, and can be used to create custom data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lists are generally created, or 'instantiated', using square brackets `[]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A new list is considered to be an 'instance' of the list object.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each item in the list is separated by a comma.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lists can be amended (they are 'mutable' - they can be changed).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Technically, a string is a list of characters, this becomes clear if we explictly make it a list."

    "* Instead of indexing by position as with lists and tuples, dictionaries are indexed by keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "* When presented with a key, the dictionary will return the associated value.\n",

    "* A dictionary key must be an immutable data type. Usually this will mean integers or strings, but it is possible to use a tuple as a dictionary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In contrast, a dictionary value can hold any combination of objects. Including other dictionaries to create 'nested' dictionaries.\n",

They are general purpose which means they are useful in many situations, however, they may not allow us to complete specific tasks as easily as we would like.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, it is really important to know a bit about lists, tuples and dictionaries because they are used throughout python, and you will be very likely to encounter them in some form. Perhaps as an output from a function or method; as a way of providing input to a procedure; or, as the way that the library you are using stores properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many advanced python libraries that have been built for specific purposes, like data science, take advantage of the fact that objects are extensible. Programmers can create new classes based on existing objects and add in specific properties or methods that do specific things. This means that general purpose objects can be customised for particular tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In data science applications, the Pandas library provides specialised objects that make working with data tables a lot easier than if we had to rely on python's general purpose objects. However, because pandas objects are specialised, they are also more complicated than general purpose objects.\n",

    "* A Series is like a one-dimensional array (effectively a list) with a label for each observation.\n",

    "\n",
    "* However, the items in a Series must all be of the same data type, unlike a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Series index provides a label for each observation, the default is for consecutive integer labels starting at 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "* However, a Series index does not have to be consecutive numbers, they can be non-unique numbers, non-consecutive numbers, as well as string objects or tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "* As such, the Series itself is a bit like a list, whereas the Series index is a bit like a dictionary, and is able to return a value in the Series based on the index, like a key-value pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Series object implements a large number of special behaviours (methods, procedures) that can be called on the data held in a Series to get useful outputs. This includes mathematical functions, like taking the average of all values in a numerical Series.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  DataFrame Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "* A DataFrame is a two-dimensional version of a Series object.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In effect, a DataFrame is a collection of Series objects - one Series for each column in the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A DataFrame is thus similar to a whole spreadsheet, like an Excel file, a STATA .dta file, a SAS file, an SPSS .sav file etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A DataFrame can hold columns with different data types, but as per Series above, any single column must contain vlaues of the same data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The dimensions are labeled in a similar way to the Series object:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **index** - refers to the row labels\n",
    "    * **columns** - refers to the column labels\n",

    " * Having indexed data allows fast look up and powerful relational operations \n",
    " \n",
    " * Each row has a label and each column has a label\n",
    "\n",
    "Most the the time you'll be working with DataFrame objects in Pandas, however, as DataFrames are composed of Series, it is very likely that through indexing, selection, creation of new columns, and analysis you'll encounter Series objects too. Luckily, DataFrame and Series objects are similar, DataFrames effectively extend the Series into two-dimensions and as such implement some additional properties and methods that may not be relevant to Series on their own."
